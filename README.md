Extensible library for building notifications and sending them via different delivery channels.

## Installation

The preferred method of installation is via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command to install 
the latest version of a package and add it to your project's `composer.json`:

```bash
composer require nikolaposa/notifier
```

## Theory of operation

Notifications are informative messages that are sent through different channels (i.e. web, SMS, mobile push) to notify 
users of something that has happened in the application. Notification is a higher-level abstraction, a concept that 
encapsulates a subject to be notified to the recipient, regardless of delivery channels through which that information 
can be communicated. From an architectural standpoint, notification is a domain concern.

In order to minimize the coupling of your domain with the infrastructure for sending notifications, Notifier library was 
based on on unobtrusive interfaces that should be implemented by your objects in order to plug them into the workflow of 
the library. Those are:

1. `Notification` - marks the object as a notification that can be used with the Notifier library,
2. `Recipient` - represents the recipient of the notification which provides contact (i.e. email address, phone number) 
for a certain channel; typically implemented by a User domain object.

For each channel through which Notification is supposed to be sent, Notification class should implement channel-specific 
interface, making the Notification suitable for sending via a specific channel. These interfaces declare message 
building methods, for example `EmailNotification::toEmailMessage()`, that convert the notification to a message sent by 
that particular channel. Channel-specific Notification interfaces extend the `Notification` interface itself, so you do 
not need to implement it explicitly.

Channel component captures implementation details of how a Notification is sent via certain delivery channels. Specific 
channel implementation typically consists of:

1. channel-specific Notification interface,
2. Message class,
3. `Channel` implementation responsible for the very act of sending the Notification.

Out of the box, this library features facilities for sending notifications via email and SMS. The highly extensible 
design allows for implementing custom delivery channels.

Finally, `Notifier` service is a facade that manages the entire process of sending a Notification to a list of 
Recipients via supported channels. It is the only service of this library that the calling code is supposed to interact 
with directly.

## Usage

**Creating Notifications**

```php
namespace App\Model;

use Notifier\Channel\Email\EmailMessage;
use Notifier\Channel\Sms\SmsMessage;
use Notifier\Channel\Email\EmailNotification;
use Notifier\Channel\Sms\SmsNotification;
use Notifier\Recipient\Recipient;

class TodoExpiredNotification implements EmailNotification, SmsNotification
{
    /** @var Todo */
    protected $todo;

    public function __construct(Todo $todo)
    {
        $this->todo = $todo;
    }

    public function toEmailMessage(Recipient $recipient): EmailMessage
    {
        return (new EmailMessage())
            ->from('noreply@example.com')
            ->subject('Todo expired')
            ->htmlBody(
                'Dear ' . $recipient->getRecipientName() . ', <br><br>'
                . 'Your todo: <b>' . $this->todo->getText() . '</b> has expired.'
            ');
    }

    public function toSmsMessage(Recipient $recipient): SmsMessage
    {
        return (new SmsMessage())
            ->text('Todo: ' . $this->todo->getText() . ' has expired');
    }
}
```

**Implementing Recipient**

```php
namespace App\Model;

use Notifier\Recipient\Recipient;

class User implements Recipient
{
    /** @var string */
    protected $name;

    /** @var array */
    protected $contacts;

    public function __construct(string $name, array $contacts)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->contacts = $contacts;
    }
    
    public funtion getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function getRecipientContact(string $channel, Notification $notification): ?string
    {
        return $this->contacts[$channel] ?? null;
    }
    
    public function getRecipientName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }
}
```

**Sending Notifications**

```php
use Notifier\Channel\Channels;
use Notifier\Channel\Email\EmailChannel;
use Notifier\Channel\Email\SimpleMailer;
use Notifier\Channel\Sms\SmsChannel;
use Notifier\Channel\Sms\TwilioTexter;
use Notifier\Notifier;
use Notifier\Recipient\Recipients;

$notifier = new Notifier(new Channels(
    new EmailChannel(new SimpleMailer()),
    new SmsChannel(new TwilioTexter('auth_id', 'auth_token'))
));

$notifier->send(
    new TodoExpiredNotification($todo), 
    new Recipients($user1, $user2, $user3)
);
```
